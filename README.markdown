# Staff

Staff is a tool that helps your websites stand up.  It's a port of the excelent 
Backbone.JS project by Jeremy Ashkenas from Document Cloud.

Back when I worked at Document Cloud with Jeremy, the code that was to eventually
become backbone really excited me.  Since then I've grown fond of vanilla ES5
APIs and wanted a version of backbone that was standalone and more like plain
JavaScript.

This is a work in progress of that port.
